A catalog of where to find valuable components (e.g. springs in mattresses or cars, high-strength magnets in speakers or hard drives, lenses in cameras), and how to test if salvaged parts are still good (multimeter use for electronics, visual inspection for cracks in metal parts via dye penetrant test from NDT techniques). Also guides on cannibalizing multiple broken units to create one working unit.
