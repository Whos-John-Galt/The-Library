Requires Chemistry (biochemistry is chemistry of life) and Physics (e.g. optics for microscopes). Feeds into Medicine (understanding pathogens, human biology), Agriculture (crop and animal breeding, soil microbiome), and Biotechnology (genetic engineering). Cross-references tie, for instance, Fermentation here to Biotech (industrial fermentation) and Agriculture (food preservation via fermentation).
