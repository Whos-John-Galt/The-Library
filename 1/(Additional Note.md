Depending on repository implementation, Earth and Space Sciences knowledge (geology, meteorology, astronomy) could be included either within fundamentals or environment sections. For completeness, basic Astronomy (for navigation and calendars) and Geology (for resource location and understanding soil, earthquakes) are documented. For example, methods to determine latitude from star positions, or geological maps linking to Materials (mineral extraction). These topics might appear under Fundamentals or under relevant applied sections like Navigation in Transportation, and Resources in Materials.)
