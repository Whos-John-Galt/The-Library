Principles of heredity (Mendelian genetics, DNA structure and replication, mutation, natural selection). Important for crop improvement, fighting diseases (e.g. understanding antibiotic resistance as an evolutionary process â€“ a pitfall if ignored). Details: DNA structure diagrams, the genetic code, examples of selective breeding outcomes, introduction to DNA sequencing techniques (linking to Biotech).
