Maps showing tectonic plates and earthquake zones, list of mineral indicators (like quartz presence in gold areas, etc.), brief instructions for making a seismometer (even a simple pendulum that marks oscillations on smoked paper). Guidelines for a community hazard plan (store food and water, have comms, know evacuation routes). Also mention historic disasters and how preparation saved lives or lack thereof cost lives (e.g. earthquake building codes in California vs Haiti differences).
