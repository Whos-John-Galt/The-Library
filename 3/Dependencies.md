Chemistry for battery reactions, Materials for suitable components (e.g. strong steel for high-pressure tanks, stable battery electrode materials), Manufacturing for precision (batteries and fuel cells can be delicate). Supports reliable operation of Energy Grids, Transportation (electric vehicles, fuel cell vehicles), and Computing (UPS systems). Cross-reference to Transportation for fuel cells in vehicles and Environment for sustainable storage (batteries recycling issues).
